                <p className='text-justify my-8'>Mia keeps everything well-organized and clean at her salon. She was compassionate and understood my skin concerns and breakout issues thoroughly. She provided me with the best herbal facial for my acne-prone skin. I havenâ€™t seen any breakouts since a month after the facial. I strongly refer her to anyone with damaged or acne-prone skin.</p>
